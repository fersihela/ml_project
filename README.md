# Machine Learning Predictive Model
## Overview
This project, developed as part of the **Data Science** course at **Esprit School of Engineering**, implements a machine learning pipeline for predictive modeling. It uses **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **Jupyter Notebooks** to preprocess data, train a **RandomForestClassifier**, evaluate performance, and visualize results. [Esprit School of Engineering](https://esprit.tn) is a leading institution in Tunisia for engineering education.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with **pandas**
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training with **scikit-learn** (RandomForestClassifier)
- Performance evaluation using **accuracy**, **F1 score**, and **confusion matrix**
- Interactive data visualization with **seaborn** and **matplotlib**

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning framework
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
### Visualization
- **seaborn**, **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis
### Other Tools
- **DVC**: Data version control
